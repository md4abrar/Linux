# When the command that is run is completed without errors the exit status will be zero.

# To manually pass an exit code based on some condition you can also pass as below 
exit 1


# To suppress the exit code from printing on terminal, we can redirect the error to /dev/null file

2>/dev/null

Ex: 
[root@instance-20211213-1640 class3]# ls -lrt

drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root    6 Jan 25 15:12 dir3
-rw-r--r-- 1 root  root  411 Jan 25 15:15 dir_content
-rw-r--r-- 1 root  root   21 Jan 25 15:12 sample.txt

[root@instance-20211213-1640 class3]# cat file 2>/dev/null
[root@instance-20211213-1640 class3]# echo $?
1

# To pass exit code 0 even if there in an error you can use OR statement like below in a script

[root@instance-20211213-1640 ~]# cat script
cat file 2>/dev/null || exit 0

[root@instance-20211213-1640 ~]# ./script

[root@instance-20211213-1640 ~]# echo $?
0



# When the file did not exist it sent the exit code as 1 but it is suppressed from printing on the terminal
[root@instance-20211213-1640 class3]# cat file_does_not_exist2 2>/dev/null

[root@instance-20211213-1640 class3]# cat file_does_not_exist 2>/dev/null
This is test

# To suppress both standard error (2) and standard output (1) to a /dev/null, you can use below command:
cat file > /dev/null 2>&1
